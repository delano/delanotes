  \r\n\
  1. \"In my adult business life I have never had to make a choice of trading between professional and personal. I tap-dance to work, and when I get there it\xE2\x80\x99s tremendous fun.\"\r\n\
  2. \"I have simple pleasures. I play bridge online for 12 hours a week. Bill and I play, he\xE2\x80\x99s chalengr and I\xE2\x80\x99m tbone.\"\r\n\
  3. \"I just naturally want to do things that make sense. In my personal life too, I don\xE2\x80\x99t care what other rich people are doing. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want a 405 foot boat just because someone else has a 400 foot boat.\"\r\n\
  4. \"I want to be able to explain my mistakes. This means I do only the things I completely understand.\"\r\n\
  5. \"The best way to own common stocks is through an index fund.\"\r\n\
  6. \"I was lucky to have the right heroes. Tell me who your heroes are and I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you how you\xE2\x80\x99ll turn out to be. The qualities of the one you admire are the traits that you, with a little practice, can make your own, and that, if practiced, will become habit-forming.\"\r\n\
  7. \"If you\xE2\x80\x99re doing something you love, you\xE2\x80\x99re more likely to put your all into it, and that generally equates to making money.\""
