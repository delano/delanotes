biasedsummary: "Apparently, pharmaceutical companies think that men aren't interested in the male pill and that women won't trust them to take them. That is such bullshit. I don't know what the real reason is, but I guarantee that isn't it. There is not a man on this earth that wants to fool a woman into getting pregnant. Unless there's cash involved. "
