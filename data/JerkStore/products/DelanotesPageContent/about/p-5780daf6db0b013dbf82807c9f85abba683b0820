  <h2>Who are you and why are you doing this to the internet?</h2>
  
  <p>My name is Delano Mandelbaum and I built Delanotes.com to practice writing summaries. It's also a pilot project for my database alternative called <a href="http://github.com/delano/jerkstore/tree/master">JerkStore</a>. </p>
  
  <p>There are other places to store URIs with notes, but the critical feature I wanted was the ability to give each one a boolean recommendation (see: <a href="#plusminus">What's with the +/-?</a>). Plus, bias is charming and human. <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>, <a href="http://popurls.com/">popurls</a> etc... are cool but the content is determined by summing and scoring the interests of an indeterminate group of individuals. I accept and appreciate bias so I created this site to care for and foster my personal bias. The content is not always correct but it's all me. </p>
  
  <p>Of course, there's also the <a href="/audio">audio content</a>.</p>

  <h2>What's with the +/-?</h2>
  
  The <img src="http://delanotes.com/i/bias-t.png" />/<img src="http://delanotes.com/i/bias-f.png" /> thing isn't my opinion of the content. It's a reminder to myself whether I can extract further value by following the URI.
  
  <ul>
  <li class="suri-true"> More than the summary.</li> 
  <li class="suri-false"> <em>Not more</em> than the summary. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where do the audio clips come from?</h2>
  
  <p>I record the audio when I'm out and about which is usually at night because I'm generally working during the day. Each track says where it was recorded and the longer ones have timed notes on the content.</p>
  
  <a name="audiolisten"></a>
  <h2>Do you expect people to listen to them?</h2>
  
  <p>Not really, but I find them entertaining. There are a lot of funny and interesting conversations happening all the time. I'm just trying to capture a few of them. </p>

  <h2>How do you record the audio?</h2>
  
  I record the audio with an Olympus LS-10.
